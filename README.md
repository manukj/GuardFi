GuardFi is a decentralized insurance platform that provides risk assessment and coverage for smart contracts. By analyzing your Solidity code and assessing risk metrics, GuardFi helps you protect against potential exploits. The platform also leverages AI, cross-chain verification with Flare, and static analysis tools to evaluate security vulnerabilities.

üöÄ Built using Next.js, Foundry, Solidity, Tailwind CSS, and integrated with Flock and Flare for advanced AI and cross-chain functionality.

- ‚úÖ **AI-Powered Risk Assessment**: Leveraging a custom-trained model (via Flock) to evaluate smart contracts on multiple security metrics.
- üîí **Cross-Chain Verification**: Uses Flare‚Äôs Data Connector to verify exploit events across blockchains, ensuring accurate and decentralized claims processing.
- üìä **Detailed Risk Metrics**: From code complexity to behavior analysis, get a comprehensive view of your smart contract's security.
- üìù **Static Analysis**: Integrated tools like Mythril and Slither for thorough contract review.
- üíº **Insurance Plans**: Customized coverage based on assessed risk levels, enabling you to protect your project against exploitation.
